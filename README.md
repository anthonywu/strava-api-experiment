# Strava API Experiment

This project is my personal experiment with [Strava's API](http://strava.github.io/api/). As a almost daily user of Strava, I have some ideas for working with my own personal data as well as public community data, but I am not ready to package this tool for public consumption yet (e.g. as a published lib or web app).

### What's inside so far

* a simple OAuth client to get a write-permission `access_token` (for developer use)
* some starter utilities to analyze my personal ride data

### Dependencies

* [hozn's 'stravalib](https://github.com/hozn/stravalib])
